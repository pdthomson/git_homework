take away 1: the old adage measure twice cut once plays in my head a lot.  When typing commands to making the correct file name etc.
take away 2: ask every question you have, share every screen shot when something isn't working right, you will get an answer and you will get help. no questions a bad question

1 strategy: I have started writing the code in my terminal as practice to a notebook thats color coded so i can refer to past uses of things and see what it looked like/what it should look like
2 strategy: I go read that days lesson twice before we have class, the first time im just reading and nothing else the second time I take notes as I go, then during class I write in additional information or notes or questions people had about certain things then I want to take a couple hours and refine the notes to another notebook and clean it all up
