take away 1: the old adage measure twice cut once plays in my head a lot.  When typing commands to making the correct file name etc.
take away 2: ask every question you have, share every screen shot when something isn't working right, you will get an answer and you will get help. no questions a bad question

1 strategy: I have started writing the code in my terminal as practice to a notebook thats color coded so i can refer to past uses of things and see what it looked like/what it should look like
2 strategy: I go read that days lesson twice before we have class, the first time im just reading and nothing else the second time I take notes as I go, then during class I write in additional information or notes or questions people had about certain things then I want to take a couple hours and refine the notes to another notebook and clean it all up

shoutout to my entire group of friends who constantly root me on and keep me afloat with love and support

I am starting to narrow down what I should be looking into as far as coding, I think I sometimes google things outside of my realm and confuse myself
